I coded object orriented car park system. It includes plate, driver's name, entering right. You can select three option adding car, parking or seeing information. If you want to add car you should select 1 and enter the car's plate and driver's name then, end of the if loop, informations was adding the "cList".
If you want to parking you should select 2 and enter your plate. If the plate match plates which is added end == False will be end == True if it is true output will "Welcome" else
"You can't enter."
If you want to see cars which are added you should select 3 
None of them the output will  "Invalid".
